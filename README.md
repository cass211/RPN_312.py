# RPN_312.py
Simple rpn arithmetic from supercharge.
The interest in rpn (reverse Polish notation) is due to years of experience with Forth.  This code is from
"Supercharged Python" by Brian Overland and John Bennett.  They use RPN to illustrate features of Python.
It seems to culminate in an RPN interpreter.  I'm curious.  Will it have any simularity to Forth?
